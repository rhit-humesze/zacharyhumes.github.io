        <!-- <p>Hello! I'm Zachary, but I go by Zach. I'm a student at the Rose-Hulman institute of technology studying computer science.</p>
        <p>My earliest programming experience was when I was 9 years old (2011) and wanted to learn to make a game for my school friends.
        </p> -->
        <p>Hello! I'm Zachary, but I go by Zach. I was born in Baltimore MD, spent my childhood in York PA, grew up in Mason OH, and currently live in Nashville, TN! 
          The image on the left was taken at Navarre Beach FL this past summer. I love (and miss) the ocean.
          I'm a student at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology pursuing a degree in computer science and (tentatively) mathematics. I like Rose, but I wish it weren't
          in a twice-landlocked state! My main interests in math/computer science are
          fractals, chaos, and artificial intelligence/deep learning. I also love physics and chemistry. Around the time I started to use the Internet frequently 
          (~7 years old) I found a website which featured the now famous <a href="https://htwins.net/scale2/">Scale of the Universe 2</a>, which was made in Flash and has since been ported to PixiJS.   
          Also on this website was an <a href="https://htwins.net/mandy/">interactive Mandelbrot set</a> made in Flash. If you visit this page now, nothing is there, because Flash is defunct.
          I didn't understand any of the math, of course, but it's what I attribute to my fascination with
          scale and self-similarity. I skipped the third grade, which was a difficult transition, because
          it also meant I would be switching schools. I've been a year younger than my peers in school since! 
        </p>
          
        <p>As a hobby, I like game design. My first programming experience was 
          when I was 9 years old and learned some Lua to make games for my schoolmates in ROBLOX... that was 9 years ago! Currently, when I get the chance, I continue to experiment writing my own or
          utilizing existing modding APIs for some of my favorite games. 
        </p>

        <p>I will sometimes draw in my spare time. I have a few sketchbooks of concept art and other things in general. I also play piano. It's the only instrument I've ever cared 
          to sit down and really try to hone. My favorite pieces are Moonlight Sonata and Gymnopedie No. 1. I've <i>tried</i> to learn Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2, but it's a 
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALqOKq0M6ho&t=325s">bit much...</a>
          Erik Satie and Franz Liszt are my favorite composers. 
        </p>

        <p>Over the past summer, I developed a love for cooking, namely seafood. My favorite thing to make are scallops. They require close attention to get just right, 
          and you have very little room for error. Too little time, and it's like you're eating a sand and saltwater-flavored gummy. A little bit too long, and they turn to rubber. But when you 
          get them just right, they melt in your mouth. I'm glad that I get to continue to cook for myself in my apartment.
        </p>

          For a few years in high school, I was on the swim team. My events were 50 and 100 meter butterfly. I never really enjoyed competitive sports, but for whatever reason
          swimming was a great fit for me.
